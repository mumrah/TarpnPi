# TARPN RaspberryPi OS Image

ðŸš§ Work In Progress ðŸš§

A Raspberry Pi distribution for [TARPN](https://tarpn.net) packet radio nodes.  

This repository contains the source script to generate the distribution out of
an existing Raspbian distro image. It is heavily inspired by the
[OctoPi repo](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi) which uses [CustomPiOs](https://github.com/guysoft/CustomPiOS)
to build a custom RaspberryPi image.
