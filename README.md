# TARPN RaspberryPi OS Image

ðŸš§ Work In Progress ðŸš§

A Raspberry Pi distribution for [TARPN](https://tarpn.net) packet radio nodes.  

This repository contains the source script to generate the distribution out of
an existing Raspbian distro image. It is heavily inspired by the
[OctoPi repo](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi) which uses [CustomPiOS](https://github.com/guysoft/CustomPiOS)
to build a custom RaspberryPi image.

# How to Develop this

The main install script is located at [src/modules/tarpn/start_chroot_script](https://github.com/mumrah/TarpnPi/blob/main/src/modules/tarpn/start_chroot_script). 
This is where `apt-get` commands, downloading custom binaries, and other installation steps should go.

After pushing to the repository, a GitHub Action will automatically build a new image. Action runs can be found on the Actions
tab in the repository.

If you have forked this repository, you must enable GitHub Actions for the repository in order for this automation to work.

At the bottom of the workflow run page ([example](https://github.com/mumrah/TarpnPi/actions/runs/11879989379)), the new image will appear as a build artifact.

To test the new image, simply download it and flash an SD card. It is also possible to verify the image using emulation
such as qemu. Here is a script that will let you run an image on Mac OS https://gist.github.com/chetbox/3d2624b3727b35cf82d68f21f2449e2c.
